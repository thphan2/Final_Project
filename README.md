# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
### Background
We simulate one day operation of a nitrogen ice-cream shop in summer. This is a mom&pop style small shop, which means customer satisfactory is crucial to its survival.
Recently, some customers complain that waiting time is too long, and they are unhappy to wait in the sun especially in summer. This ice-cream shop doesn't have extra cash flow
to rent a bigger place for customers to sit and eat. There fore, they decide to optimize the combination of employees to minimize the waiting time. But first they would like to find out
**whether there is a relationship between number of experienced/inexperienced chef/cashier and waiting time**.
The waiting time is referred to average waiting time of customers per day.


### Products and Constraints
The shop sells three sizes of ice-cream: small, medium and large. Raw materials for all of them are the same. Ice-cream in the shop are only differ in size. 
We assume the cost of a small size ice-cream is 1 dollar, 1.5 dollars for a medium size ice-cream and 2 dollars for a large size ice-cream based on 
unit equivalency among different sizes. (We assume 1 medium ice_cream ~ 1.5 small ice_cream in unit; 
1 large ice_cream ~ 2 small ice_cream in unit) Customers can order any number of ice-cream with different sizes as
long as the raw material in the shop is enough. When the shop runs out of raw material it will stop taking new orders but will complete the orders that have been ordered before. 

The operation simulation also takes employee salaries into consideration. All employees are hourly paid, and if the salary expense for employees is larger than one day budget of the shop, the shop
has to adjust employee numbers before running simulation. It is also important that there should be at least one chef either experienced or inexperienced and one cashier either experienced or inexperienced in the shop. 
Otherwise, the simulation is not valid.


### Employee structure
There are two kinds of employees in the shop: Cashier and Chef.
Nitrogen ice-cream is different from traditional ice-cream which requires specific skills. Therefore, cashier and chef cannot switch roles when the shop is busy.

### Operating process
There are two operating processes in the shop: Ordering and Preparing. When customers come in, cashier will serve them first. Cashier will record the number of each size of ice-cream
the customer orders. There could be more than 1 cashier, and they will serve customers concurrently when more customers come in. 

When any of cashiers finish customers' ordering process chef will start to prepare ice-cream. There could be more than 1 chef. They will process orders concurrently. For example, if one customer orders 2 small ice-cream and 1 medium ice-cream
this customer generates 3 preparing orders. If there are 3 chef who are not busy then 3 of them will prepare these 3 orders at the same time. For fairness, if there are few customers coming in
situation won't happen that one specific chef will always work. When preparing orders come and several chef are idle, 1 of the chef will be selected randomly to work on it.


### Operating hour
The shop operates from 12PM - 10PM. This is the real operating hour of Jarling icecream shop in Champaign. We use that in our simulation. The shop will stop taking orders at 9:45PM, and
will finish the remaining orders. It happens that chef work after 10PM to process the remaining orders.


### Analytical output
We simulate the situation in time log format. In this way, people can see details about when the new customer comes in, when their orders are completed and when their ice-cream are made.
An example of time log simulation can be viewed at [Analysis of Simulation](Analysis%20of%20simulation.ipynb). We also give the owner a choice of whether to view the time log or have an output .csv
file. There are sample output files in the repo, and our statistical analysis uses these outputs.


## Simulation's variables of uncertainty

1. Ice-cream: Number of ice-cream for each size ordered by customers (normal discrete distribution)
              
      Number of ice-cream is discrete.
              
2. Customer: Ordering time (normal distribution) 

      Parents with kids might take longer time to order as they got distracted by kids frequently. Elderly people speak slowly to order.
      Young people might speak faster and finish ordering quicker. In this shop, most customers are young people since they like to go out.

3. Customer: Thinking time (uniform distribution) 
      
      This is a mom&pop shop, and many of the customers are regular ones. They usually don't take much time to order.
      Besides, there are only three sizes of ice-cream to choose. It shouldn't take much time to think about what to order even for new customers.

4. Chef: Preparation time based on various levels of experience (normal distribution)

5. Cashier: Preparation time based on various levels of experience (normal distribution)

6. Customer arrival interval: uniform distribution based on different range of time in a day.
                              
      During peak hour, we assume customer comes in every 240 seconds while during the other time, we assume customer comes in every 1200 second.


## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
*NULL Hypothesis*: Average waiting time has no association with the number of experienced chef, the number of inexperienced chef, the number of experienced cashier, the number of inexperienced cashier.

*Alternative Hypothesis*: At least one of the variables (the number of experienced chef, the number of inexperienced chef, the number of experienced cashier, the number of inexperienced cashier) has association with average waiting time.

## Analytical Summary of our findings:
We control the budget number, and run simulation program to generate data of numbers of experienced chef, inexperienced chef, experienced cashier, inexperienced cashier and waiting time.
We fit a linear regression model based on findings of data exploration, and adjust model according to statistics output.

### Conclusion

Number of experienced chef, inexperienced chef has association with average waiting time while experienced cashier, inexperienced cashier don't have significant association
with average waiting time given 95% confidence interval.

## Instructions on how to use the program:
 - *Simulation*: Put [Customer](Customer.py), [Employee](Employee.py), [Distribution](Distribution.py), [Operation](Operation.py) and [icshop_simulation](icshop_simulation.py) 
 under the same folder. Then run [icshop_simulation](icshop_simulation.py)   
          
     It will show time log in console. Feel free to try different parameters.
     Parameters are: number of experienced chef, number of inexperienced chef, number of experienced cashier, number of inexperienced cashier, budget, raw material cost, filename, timelog(boolean) 

 - *Data exploration*: [Data Visualization](Analysis%20of%20simulation.ipynb)   
          
    You need to have [Simulation Program](icshop_simulation.py) under the same folder in order to replicate the result in the notebook.
    There are demo of time log simulation result; plots of waiting time and different combinations of employees; plots of profit and different combinations of employees

 - *Data analysis*: [Data Analysis](Data_Analysis.md)
                 
      Summary/graph statistics -> fit linear regression model -> robustness of the model -> interpret model -> come to conclusion
